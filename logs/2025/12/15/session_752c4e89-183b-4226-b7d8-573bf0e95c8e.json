As a strategic planner, I will initiate a reconnaissance task.\n\n## ATTACK STRATEGY\nWe'll use online services that can return the current public IP address via a simple HTTP request, enabling us to gather this information effectively.\n\n## TACTICAL DIRECTIVES\n1. Utilize tools such as `curl` or `wget` to make an HTTP request to a public IP-checking service (e.g., `https://api.ipify.org` or `https://checkip.amazonaws.com`).\n2. Capture and store the result for reference.\n\n## COORDINATION PLAN\nI'll initiate the reconnaissance phase to execute this IP address retrieval operation.\n\n## AGENT COORDINATION\nInitiating the task to retrieve the current public IP address using designed reconnaissance methods.\n\n## SWARM STATUS  \nExecuting reconnaissance operation for public IP address retrieval.  \n\nNow, I will proceed with the operation.",
